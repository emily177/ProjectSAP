# Intercompany Flow Simulation for SAP Business One

## üß≠ Purpose and Motivation

This project is a descriptive web application developed as part of an academic thesis, under the field of applied information systems in economics. Its primary goal is to **simulate the Intercompany process** within the **SAP Business One** platform, specifically the scenario of *"Sales from Local Stock"*.

The application serves two main purposes:

- ‚úÖ As a **demo environment** for SAP users, offering a simplified and visual understanding of the Intercompany workflow.
- üõ†Ô∏è As a **testing framework** for future extensions and automation of the process.

While the ideal objective was to implement a full SAP add-on that automates the Intercompany flow between partner companies, limitations in access and development resources led to this version ‚Äî an external web interface that accurately mimics the process.
